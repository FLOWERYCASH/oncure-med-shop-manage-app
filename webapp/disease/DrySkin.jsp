					<br> <span><h3>OVERVIEW</h3></span>
					<p>Dry skin refers to rough, flaky, itchy, or scaly skin. It is
						caused by disturbed skin barrier and lack of natural lipids in the
						skin. Dry skin can be seasonal or can develop due to some
						underlying medical conditions such as dermatitis, psoriasis,
						hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, etc. The symptoms of
						dry skin can be triggered by using harsh cleansers, cold weather,
						and frequent exposure of water. The people who are working in
						certain occupations such as catering, hairdressings, healthcare,
						construction, woodwork, and rubber industry are at higher risk of
						developing dry skin due to continuous exposure to water and harsh
						chemicals. Stress, anxiety, and lack of water intake can also make
						the skin more prone to dryness. Dry skin can be easily managed and
						treated through self care and medical help. Keeping the skin moist
						through moisturizer and protecting the skin from sun round the
						year are the fundamental keys to manage it. Wearing loose cotton
						clothes over tight synthetic fabrics are also of great help. If
						not treated timely, dry skin can make it more prone to infections,
						severe itching and more severe skin conditions like eczema,
						contact dermatitis etc.</p>

					<span><h3>Symptoms Of Dry Skin</h3></span>
					<p>Dry skin is mostly seasonal, typically occurring during
						winters. The symptoms may vary based on a person's age, skin tone,
						health conditions, living environment and can include:</p>
