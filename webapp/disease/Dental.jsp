					<br> <span><h3>OVERVIEW</h3></span>
					<p>Most of us might have experienced toothache at least once in
						our lifetime. A toothache or dental pain is any pain that
						originates from the tooth and its surrounding structures such as
						the gums.The intensity of pain may range from mild dull aching to
						severe excruciating pain. Toothache can occur from various dental
						causes like tooth cavity, tooth fracture, broken old fillings, gum
						infections, grinding of teeth etc. Rarely, pain is experienced in
						teeth because of non dental causes like sinusitis, heart attack,
						lockjaw, trigeminal neuralgia etc. Therefore, it is important to
						differentiate dental pain from such conditions that cause referred
						pain in the teeth. Dental pain can happen at any age, but it is
						more common in school going children or the elderly population.
						Following good oral hygiene practices is one of the simple yet
						effective ways to keep teeth and gums healthy and prevent dental
						pain. In case when dental pain is experienced, painkillers and
						some home remedies might provide temporary relief but a dental
						consultation followed by required dental procedures are highly
						recommended.</p>

					<span><h3>Symptoms Of Dental Pain</h3></span>
					<p>Dental pain can vary in intensity from mild to severe. It
						can also range from dull-aching pain to sharp-shooting pain based
						on the causative factors. A range of symptoms can be seen with
						dental pain such as:</p>

					<ol style="font-size: 17px;">

						<li><b>Dull-aching toothache that may radiate to the gums
								or jaws.</b></li>
						<li><b>Pain that worsens while biting or chewing food. </b></li>
						<li><b>Pain exacerbated by excessively hot or cold foods
								or sweets.</b></li>

						<li><b>Pain accompanied by bleeding or discharge from the
								gums. </b></li>
