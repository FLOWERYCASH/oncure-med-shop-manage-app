					<br> <span><h3>OVERVIEW</h3></span>
					<p>Back pain is one of the most common pain complaints that
						almost everyone has had at some point in their lives. This pain is
						felt in the back of the body, stretching from the shoulders to the
						hips. Back pain can be either acute or chronic. When pain strikes
						suddenly and lasts for a few days, it is referred to as "acute."
						Symptoms are typically sudden and transient. Chronic back pain
						lasts for more than three months and returns regularly, making
						daily activities difficult. Increasing age is a significant risk
						factor for back pain. Factors like injuries, inactive lifestyle,
						poor posture, illness, strains, injuries, and fractures can
						contribute to back pain. It can be prevented by lifestyle
						modifications, like being physically active, losing excess body
						weight, maintaining good posture, managing stress, and getting
						adequate good quality sleep. Most cases of back pain can be
						managed by over the counter medications and topical ointments.
						However, in case of chronic back pain, it is important to seek
						medical treatment to avoid long-term complications.</p>

					<span><h3>Symptoms Of Back Pain</h3></span>
					<p>The main symptom is an ache or pain anywhere in the back.
						Pain may be described as a shooting, burning, or stabbing
						sensation. In addition, the pain may sometimes radiate down to the
						buttocks and legs or worsen with bending, twisting, lifting,
						standing, or walking. It may also occur along with other symptoms
						such as:</p>
