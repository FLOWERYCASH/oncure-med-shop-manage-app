					<p>Dehydration is simply a lack of water in the body. Our
						bodies are made up of roughly 60% water, which is required for
						almost every bodily function. Water can be lost from the body as a
						result of excessive sweating on a hot summer day or strenuous
						exercise. Even fever or excessive urination can cause a decrease
						in the body's overall water level. Dry mouth, excessive thirst,
						tiredness, dark-colored urine, and less frequent urination are all
						symptoms of dehydration. But if left unattended, it can cause
						headaches, bad breath, dry skin, and in rare cases, lead to a
						medical emergency. So, if you experience dehydration, you can even
						try out some simple and effective home remedies to help restore
						mineral and fluid balance in the body. Medical attention is
						required in case of severe dehydration .</p>
