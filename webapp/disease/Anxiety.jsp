					<p>Anxiety disorders are the most common types of mental health
						conditions. According to a survey in 2017, 44.9 million Indians
						were estimated to be suffering from anxiety disorders. Anxiety
						disorder is twice as likely to affect females than males. It is
						normal to feel a little anxious and stressed about challenging
						situations that arise in life. However, when the feeling of
						anxiety interfere with a person’s day-to-day life, such a
						condition is suspected to be an anxiety disorder. People who
						suffer from anxiety disorders, phobias, or who have a history of
						panic attacks often try to avoid situations or things that
						precipitate their anxiety. They are unable to lead a normal life
						and live in fear of challenging situations. If episodes of anxiety
						become too frequent and severe, and start affecting a person’s
						quality of life and everyday behavior, it is essential to visit a
						doctor to seek care for anxiety. Medications, psychotherapy, and
						lifestyle modifications can help alleviate the symptoms of anxiety</p>
