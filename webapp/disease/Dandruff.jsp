					<br> <span><h3>OVERVIEW</h3></span>
					<p>Dandruff is a common hair problem that needs no
						introduction. It affects around 50% of people worldwide at some
						point in their life, irrespective of their gender and ethnicity.


						Dandruff is a scalp disorder which causes the scalp to flake
						and/or itch. The dead cells on the scalp tend to stick to each
						other due to surface debris and oil on the scalp. This in turn
						leads to flakes with itchy scalp and also causes the hair to shed
						at a faster than normal rate. Dandruff is seen to mostly occur
						between puberty to middle-age as this is the phase when the
						sebaceous glands are most active. The severity of dandruff may
						fluctuate with the season but it usually worsens during winter. If
						left untreated, it can cause fungal infections of the skin & may
						also lead to severe hair fall. The common treatment options for
						dandruff include use of home remedies and medicated shampoos.</p>

					<span><h3>Symptoms Of Dandruff</h3></span>
					<p>Flakes due to dry scalp tend to be smaller and whiter.
						Dandruff flakes are larger and usually yellow-tinged due to oily
						scalp.</p>
