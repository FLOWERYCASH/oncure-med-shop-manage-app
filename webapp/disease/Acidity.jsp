					<br><span><h3>OVERVIEW</h3></span>
					<p>Acidity is one of the most common ailments that almost
						everyone experiences once in their lifetimes. In simple terms, it
						is a condition that causes excess acid production in the stomach.
						This not only causes discomfort in the stomach but also leads to
						other symptoms, such as a sour taste in the mouth, difficulty
						swallowing, and indigestion. There are numerous causes of acidity,
						right from poor eating habits and excessive stress to the use of
						certain medications. Moreover, lifestyle factors, such as smoking
						and consuming foods loaded with oil, fats, and spices, can also up
						your risk of acidity. If you experience acidity once in a while,
						it may not indicate any health issues. However, if you suffer from
						frequent bouts of acidity, where the symptoms occur at least two
						or more days per week, there might be some underlying disorder
						associated with it. It is advised to consult your doctor in such
						cases. You can fight acidity with simple lifestyle changes and
						effective home remedies, such as tulsi, mint, fennel seeds, and
						cold milk. In most cases, over-the-counter medications to
						reduce/neutralize the acid are known to be of great help.</p>

					<span><h3>Symptoms Of Acidity</h3></span>
					<p>The symptoms of acidity occur when some of the acid content
						of the stomach flows back up into the esophagus or the food pipe,
						which connects the mouth to the stomach. Normally, a ring of
						muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) acts as a valve
						that lets food enter the stomach but does not allow it back up
						into the esophagus. When this valve fails to function properly,
						stomach contents are regurgitated into the esophagus and the
						following symptoms of acidity can be experienced:</p>

						<li><b>Regurgitation</b></li>
						<li><b>Sour taste in the mouth</b></li>

						<li><b>Difficulty in swallowing</b></li>
						<li><b> Sore throat</b></li>
						<li><b>Indigestion</b></li>
